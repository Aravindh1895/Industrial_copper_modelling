# Industrial_copper_modelling

## Copper Industry Data Analysis and Machine Learning
This Jupyter Notebook contains a data analysis and machine learning project for the copper industry. It addresses issues related to sales and pricing data by using machine learning techniques to improve pricing decisions and lead classification.

## Project Overview
The project includes the following components:

- Data Exploration: Analyzing data to identify skewness and outliers.
- Data Preprocessing: Transforming and cleaning the data to prepare it for machine learning.
- Machine Learning Regression Model: Building a regression model to predict the continuous variable 'Selling_Price'.
- Machine Learning Classification Model: Developing a classification model to predict the lead status as 'WON' or 'LOST'.
## Prerequisites
Before running this Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook Copper_Industry_Analysis.ipynb in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the following tasks:
Explore and understand the provided data.
Preprocess the data by cleaning and transforming it.
Build and evaluate the machine learning models.
